# Couloir 14, graphic assets

:floppy_disk: This repository contains the graphic sources for the demoscene production **Couloir 14**. These sources are mostly made up of [Lightwave 3D 5.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightWave_3D) files (.lws, .lwo, .jpg, .tga). The demo is essentially a script of Lightwave scenes replayed by an [extremely sophisticated player](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=93899).

## Running the Demo

To run the demo from the assets, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download the original scene player developed by XBarr:
  - found in [demo-couloir14-assets/S3DE_player](demo-couloir14-assets/S3DE_player)
  - or from https://github.com/demoscene-source-archive/preservation-nxng-engine
2. Edit the file `mount_folder_1st.bat` to set the local folder where the assets were cloned.
3. Start the Scene player (`nX_S3DE.exe`).
4. Load the playlist file `demo.spl`.
5. Select your screen resolution, click on `Fullscreen`.
6. Click on `Replay`.

The demo can be seen on Youtube as well: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZlOK5H9qtE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZlOK5H9qtE)

> **Notes on Folder Structure**

 It's crucial to set up the correct folder structure for the demo to work properly. You will need to mount the local folder containing the assets to the folder that is referenced throughout the Lightwave files (in this case, `T:\`).

 For example, if your local folder is `C:/Couloir14/assets`, you would need to edit the file `mount_folder_1st.bat` (that is essentially doing a `subst` MS-DOS command).

# About this demoscene production

:pill: Introducing "C̴o̵u̵l̶o̵i̸r̵ ̶1̵4," a c̵o̸n̵t̷r̵o̶v̵e̶r̵s̷i̵a̸l̵ demoscene *production* released in 2001 that has p̸u̵z̶z̵l̸e̵d̸ the m̶i̵n̸d̵s̸ of enthusiasts and experts alike. This p̸e̵r̸p̵l̷e̵x̶i̸n̵g̵ creation is infamous for its *p̵o̸l̵a̴r̵i̶z̸i̴n̴g̷* visuals, d̴i̷s̵s̷o̵n̸a̵n̶t̷ *audio*, and c̵o̸n̴v̴o̴l̸u̸t̸e̴d̷ coding techniques that question the limits of *digital* art and expression.

What *i̷s̵o̸l̵a̶t̵e̷s̵* "Couloir 14" from other d̵e̶m̵o̸s̵c̶e̵n̸e̵ productions is the air of obscurity that s̵u̸r̵r̵o̵u̶n̵d̸s̵ it. Gossip has circulated about the o̸r̵i̶g̵i̵n̷s̵ and absurd messages within the piece, sparking n̸u̵m̶e̶r̵o̵u̷s̶ *investigations* and *m̸i̶s̷u̸n̶d̷e̴r̵s̷t̶a̸n̴d̴i̷n̴g̸s*. Many have speculated that the creators of "Couloir 14" were part of a c̷l̵a̸n̵d̶e̵s̵t̸i̷n̵e̸ group or movement that aimed to p̶r̸o̵v̷o̶k̸e̵ *controversy* and promote n̷o̴n̸c̷o̶n̴f̵o̴r̷m̸i̴t̴y̵.

Some theories suggest that "C̴o̷u̴l̸o̷i̴r̴ 14" contains c̴r̷y̴p̵t̴i̵c̷ references to *d̴i̷s̵r̸e̷p̴u̵t̴a̶b̷l̸e̵* historical events and s̶u̸b̸v̶e̷r̵s̸i̷v̶e̵ ideas, while others argue that the work is a c̸r̵i̵t̶i̸q̵u̷e̵ on the rapidly <small>d̴e̷t̴e̸r̷i̵o̶r̶a̴t̷i̴n̶g̷ digital *landscape* of the time. The *production*'s e̴n̵i̴g̷m̴a̵t̷i̵c̴ nature has also fueled speculation about the true *identities* of its creators, with some *attributing* the work to contentious figures within the d̶e̴m̷o̸s̶c̷e̵n̶e̸ community or even an underground collective working in the *s̶h̷a̵d̶o̷w̸s̷*.</small>

Adding to the *intrigue* of "C̴o̵u̴l̴o̴i̵r̷ 14," a J̸a̴p̵a̷n̵e̸s̵e̴ adult magazine made the bold decision to publish the d̷e̵m̶o̷ in an attempt to provide a "d̶e̶m̷o̸s̶h̷o̵c̷k" to the *J̶a̷p̵a̷n̶e̸s̷e̵* audience. The magazine, known for pushing boundaries and exploring u̶n̷c̷o̷n̶v̷e̵n̶t̶i̸o̷n̷a̶l̷ *content*, believed that the p̷r̵o̶v̵o̸c̵a̷t̵i̷v̵e̸ nature of "Couloir 14" would *resonate* with their *readers* and challenge their *perceptions* of d̴i̵g̴i̶t̷a̵l̷ art.
