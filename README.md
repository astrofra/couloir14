Many have speculated that the creators of "Couloir 14" were part of a clandestine group or movement that aimed to provoke controversy and promote nonconformity.

Some theories suggest that "Couloir 14" contains cryptic references to disreputable historical events and subversive ideas, while others argue that the work is a critique on the rapidly deteriorating digital landscape of the time. The production's enigmatic nature has also fueled speculation about the true identities of its creators, with some attributing the work to contentious figures within the demoscene community or even an underground collective working in the shadows.
