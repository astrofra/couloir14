      <p><span class="hank">Hank:</span> You got my ear, Rob. What'd you find?</p>
      <p><span class="rob">Rob:</span> We ain't tryin' to convince nobody. Just sharin' our scientific know-how. We can't sort out fact from fiction, but our experience in aerospace makes us the right guys for the job.</p>
      <p><span class="hank">Hank:</span> So, what's the deal with those WWII German and American prototypes?</p>
      <p><span class="rob">Rob:</span> We think they're the real McCoy, Hank. But we also respect them historians who call 'em a hoax. Their methods lead 'em there.</p>
      <p><span class="hank">Hank:</span> What's our next move then?</p>
      <p><span class="rob">Rob:</span> We oughta use methods like criminal investigators or investigative journalists, instead of just historical tools. Met a couple of old-timers who saw them flyin' saucers back in the day. Their stories were convincin'.</p>
      <p><span class="hank">Hank:</span> Intriguing. We'll keep diggin', then. Keep me in the loop, Rob.</p>
      <p><span class="rob">Rob:</span> Sure thing, Hank. Take care, and we'll catch up soon.</p>
